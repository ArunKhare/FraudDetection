saving a object: 
    - Object must be of class type. i.e it has to have class_attribute
    - file path needs to include the file_name.extension
    - name of the file should be of permissible length
    - yaml file : create_directories without the file_name extension, while writing file in the directory open the filepath with extension.write the data and close the connection
    
logging each output
